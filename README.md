# Woolich Log File Decoder

**Warning: This repo and it's owner has no association nor affiliation with Woolich Racing. This repo came into existence in order to overcome limitations and bugs in the woolich software and to enable users of the woolich logging tools to access their own data**

### License
While this is GNU GPLv2 please respect Woolich's IP and don't attempt to undercut their business using this software. Honestly I don't know how you could with this, because this actually makes their software better, but it needs to be said.

### Supported ECU's 
Currently supported:
- MT09SP 2023

Potentially supported:
- MT09SP 2021 - 2022
- MT09 2021 - 2023

If you have logs for a bike feel free to send them in and I will try and decode them. Without a license key for the bike it could be tricky but it's worth a shot.

### Why does this repo exist?

The reason for this can be understood by watching the youtube playlist 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNZLtrzuuwY&list=PLKNjpzEkK2wLMr8a8zEwzBNT63SJbxuuI
where I work my way through the many aspects (both good and bad) of the Woolich software.

There are many limitations in the Woolich Racing software and they "presumably" don't have the resources to fix every little issue pertainint to one single model of motorcycle out of the somewhat crazy number of bikes that are out there. Thats a realistic approach from their perspective and there's no negativity directed towards them. We're all just grateful that they're decoding the ECU's at all and allowing us to have our bikes flashed.

### Disclaimer
The repo is obviously a simple winforms application in c#. That's because I needed something simple that could be put together easily and modified easily as new functions were needed. This repo is not intended to showcase my development skills. I have a day job for that.

TODO:
Implement some CI/CD mechanisms and an installer bundle once I work out how. It's my first time with public repos :-)
